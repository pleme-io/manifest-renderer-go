## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-03

### Added
- Initial: a typed `Source` (functional options) rendered byte-stable to three
  manifest dialects — `RenderHelm()` (chart), `RenderKustomize()` (base+overlay),
  and `RenderOpenShift()` (SCC-aware Deployment + Route). Deterministic internal
  YAML emitter (no external dep), `Files` path→bytes set with sorted `Paths()`,
  and typed code-carrying errors via `errors-go` (`manifest_invalid`).
